/**
 
 ** Exercise 2: What 's your Monday worth? **
 
 Write a function that finds out what your hourly rate on a Monday would be
 Use the map array function to take out the duration time for each task.
 Avoid using for loop or forEach.
 Multiply each duration by a per - hour rate for billing and sum it all up.
 Output a formatted Euro amount, rounded to Euro cents, e.g: €11.34.
 Make sure the function can be used on any array of objects that contain a duration property with a number value
