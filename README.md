# Module #3 - JavaScript 2: DOM Manipulation (Frontend)

![JavaScript2](./assets/javascript2.png)

If you were to ask a random person on the street the question "What is a browser?", you'll most likely get a variety of (incorrect) answers. For proof, check [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4MwTvtyrUQ) out.

You might be one of those people right now, but after this module no more. In **JavaScript2** you'll learn all about how to use JavaScript within the browser.

## Learning goals

In order to successfully complete this module you will need to master the following:

- Understand what the `DOM` is
- Use the basics of `DOM Manipulation`
- Differentiate between `synchronous` and `asynchronous` operations
- Gain awareness of the inner workings of JavaScript
- Learn to think based on `principles`, instead of libraries and frameworks

## How to use this repository

This repository consists of 3 essential parts:

1. `Reading materials`: this document contains all the required theory you need to know _**while**_ you're coding. It's meant as both study material and as a reference to understand what you're doing.
2. `Homework`: this document contains the instructions for each week's homework.
3. `Lesson Plans`: this part is meant for teachers as a reference. However, as a student don't be shy to take a look at it as well!

After your first class you should start off with checking the `reading materials` for that week. At the beginning that would be the [Week 1 Reading](/Week1/README.md). Study all the concepts and try to get the gist of everything. After, you can get started with the `homework` for that week.

If you have any questions or if something is not entirely clear ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯, please ask/comment on Slack!
