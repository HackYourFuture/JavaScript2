# DEPRECATED - JavaScript 2
This module has been replace with the Browsers module, find it [here](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/Browsers)


```If you were to ask a random person on the street the question "What is a browser?", you'll most likely get a variety of (incorrect) answers. For proof, check [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4MwTvtyrUQ) out.

You might be one of those people right now, but after this module no more. In **JavaScript2** you'll learn all about how to use JavaScript within the browser.

## Learning goals

In order to successfully complete this module you will need to master the following:

- Understand what the `DOM` is
- Use the basics of `DOM Manipulation`
- Differentiate between `synchronous` and `asynchronous` operations
- Gain awareness of the inner workings of JavaScript
- Learn to think based on `principles`, instead of libraries and frameworks

## How to use this repository

### Repository content

This repository consists of 3 essential parts:

1. `README`: this document contains all the required theory you need to understand **while** working on the homework. It contains not only the right resources to learn about the concepts, but also lectures done by HackYourFuture teachers. This is the **first thing** you should start with every week
2. `MAKEME`: this document contains the instructions for each week's homework. Start with the exercises rather quickly, so that you can ground the concepts you read about earlier.
3. `LESSONPLAN`: this document is meant for teachers as a reference. However, as a student don't be shy to take a look at it as well!

### How to study

Let's say you are just starting out with the JavaScript2 module. This is what you do...

1. The week always starts on **Wednesday**. First thing you'll do is open the `README.md` for that week. For the first week of `JavaScript2`, that would be [Week1 Reading](/Week1/README.md)
2. You spend **Wednesday** and **Thursday** going over the resources and try to get a basic understanding of the concepts. In the meanwhile, you'll also implement any feedback you got on last week's homework (from the JavaScript1 module)
3. On **Friday** you start with the homework, found in the `MAKEME.md`. For the first week of `JavaScript2`, that would be [Week1 Homework](/Week1/MAKEME.md)
4. You spend **Friday** and **Saturday** playing around with the exercises and write down any questions you might have
5. **DEADLINE 1**: You'll submit any questions you might have before **Saturday 23.59**, in the class channel
6. On **Sunday** you'll attend class. It'll be of the Q&A format, meaning that there will be no new material. Instead your questions shall be discussed and you can learn from others
7. You spend **Monday** and **Tuesday** finalizing your homework
8. **DEADLINE 2**: You submit your homework to the right channels (GitHub) before **Tuesday 23.59**. If you can't make it on time, please communicate it with your mentor
9. Start the new week by going back to point 1!
