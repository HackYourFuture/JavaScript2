// in the f1 function we use (const x = 9); The variable equals to a primitive value(undefined, null, boolean, string, and numbers). In Pass by Value,
// Function is called by directly passing the value of the variable as the argument. Changing the argument inside the function
// doesnâ€™t affect the variable passed from outside the function. So changing the value of the variable with a function never
// changes the underlying primitive (String or number).

// in the f2 function we use (const y = { x: 9 }); it equals to an object. In Pass by Reference, Function is called by directly
// passing the reference/address of the variable as the argument. Changing the argument inside the function affect the variable
// passed from outside the function. The reference/address of the objects and arrays same but the values at that addresses changed.
