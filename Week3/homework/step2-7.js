// Add your explanation as a comment here
// Pass by reference is when variables passed in to functions are given the direct memory address.
// This allows the function to manipulate the object or primitive as it exists outside the scope of the function.
// Pass by value means that when you pass that variable into a function its the equivalent of creating a new variable and making a copy of the passed in variable.
// Theyâ€™re not necessarily the same exact variable in the same exact memory address but rather copies. Modifying the copy does not affect the original.
