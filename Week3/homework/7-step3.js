// In Pass by Value(the first function), Function is called by directly passing the value of the variable as the argument.Changing the argument inside the function doesnâ€™t affect the variable passed from outside the function. In Javascript numbers and strings follows pass by reference.

// In Pass by Reference(the second function), Function is called by directly passing the reference/address of the variable as the argument. Changing the argument inside the function affect the variable passed from outside the function. In Javascript objects and arrays follows pass by reference.
