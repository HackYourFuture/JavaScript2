## Test
At the end of this module you'll be doing a formative test. It will be done on **paper** and will consist of **4 exercises** that will test your JavaScript1 and JavaScript2 knowledge. 

Why on paper, you might ask? Fundamental understanding should become intuitive. Only after having learned and mastered a concept deeply will you be able to use it creatively. If you rely too much on others, or Google, you'll make it very hard to cultivate the habit to think for yourself.

Also important to note: this test is done for 2 reasons only.

(1) **HackYourFuture wants to know** what skill level you are at. 

(2) The test will **give you an indication** of what skill level you are at.


### Overall
A good understanding of all the above mentioned topics. Want to check your Knowledge? Go through the [JavaScript Fundamentals README](../../../fundamentals/blob/master/fundamentals/README.md) and research/ ask for help (Slack!) with the concepts that are not entirely clear.
