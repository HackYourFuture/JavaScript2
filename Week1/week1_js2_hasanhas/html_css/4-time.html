<!-- Why wear a watch when you can check the time, live in your webpage?
Create an empty HTML file, called time.html
Create a JavaScript file called showCurrentTime.js and include it in the HTML file
Inside the JS file, write a function that adds the current time to the webpage. 
Make sure it's written in the HH:MM:SS notation (hour, minute, second). 
Hint: use setInterval() to make sure the time stays current
Have the function execute when it's loading in the browser -->
