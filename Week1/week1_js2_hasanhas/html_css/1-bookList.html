<!-- Iterate through the array of books.
For each book, create a <p> element with the book title and author and append it to the page.
Use a <ul> and <li> to display the books.
Add an <img> to each book that links to a URL of the book cover.
Change the style of the book depending on whether you have read it (green) or not (red).
The end result should look something like this: https://hyf-js2-week1-makeme-ex1-demo.herokuapp.com/ -->
