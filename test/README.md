# JavaScript1 and JavaScript2 Test

You’ll be doing a comprehension test. It will be about the most important JavaScript concepts you’ve learned about so far (JavaScript1 and JavaScript2). 

## Practical information
Practical information about the test will be shared in the class channel prior to the test. Keep an eye on it!

## Purpose of the test
The purpose of this exam is to test your comprehension of JavaScript 1 and JavaScript 2 concepts.
- The goal for us is to know how solid your knowledge is and if you need any extra assistance throughout the program.
- The goal for you is to test how well enough you master the material so far.
Like the homework you will get feedback and are expected to improve upon your weak points.

## Test material
These are the most important concepts that will be tested:
- `Variables`
- `Data types` (`strings`, `numbers`, `arrays`, `objects`, `booleans`)
- `Conditional statements` (`if`/`switch` statement)
- `Loops`
- `ES5 functions` and `arrow functions`
- How to use JavaScript to do basic `DOM manipulations` (add, modify and remove DOM elements)
- `Code commenting`
- `Array functions` (`map` and `filter`)
- `Callbacks`

## Preparation
Advice on how to optimally prepare:
- Find out 2 things about each concepts listed above: (1) how does the basic structure look and (2) what is the most common use case.

- Be familiar with creating a new project repository in github. For the test you will get some files to edit and they will need to be uploaded to your github.

- Ask questions through Slack to your teachers and/or your classmates

- Practice for understanding (why something is the case), NOT just for repetition’s sake (and hoping ‘you will understand it one day’).

- Make a summary of all the study material.

- After you prepared try to make the sample questions that are in this file.

## During the test
Advise on how to make a test:
- **Look for low hanging fruit**. Which of the assignments is easiest for you to do? Tackle that one first. 
- **If you get stuck in an assignment, move on to the next one**. You can always come back later if time permits.
- After finishing an assignment, read the question again to **make sure you actually gave an answer to the question**. 
- Before handing in the test, read it all over again to pick out the small mistakes. **Double check your work!**

## Sample questions
1. Write and call a function that creates and appends a <p> tag to the <body> of an HTML file. Make use of the already predefined DOM methods createElement() and appendChild(). The innerText of the <p> should be “hello HackYourFuture!”.

2. Transform the given array of strings named letters into a new array with numbers (for example: `numbers = [0, 1, 2, 3 ]` ), by creating a new function called lettersToNumbers. Log the new array to the console. Return the new array. Make use of the map() array function. 
`const letters = [ ‘a’ , ‘b’ , ‘c’ , ‘d’ ];`
